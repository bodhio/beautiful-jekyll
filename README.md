## About

To help bridge the gap between the art that I produce and the technology that I use, I decided to create a website which provides a place to curate my creations in an online realm. 

## Contact

I am open to commissions, collaboration, and general feedback. If you are interested contacting me for any reason, here is how you can get in touch:

## Credits

bodh.io is built, designed, and managed completely on a web-browser, the only expenditure was on the domain name and the of course time/effort. Here are some of the digital products and tools which have enabled bodh.io to exist in its current form:
