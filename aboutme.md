## Bio
Hi, my name is Brian and I am an emerging artist - born in Toronto, based in London, and creating for the universe. An avid lover of philosophy and hip-hop, I spend my days working in tech and at night Iâ€™m exploring the fine craft of printmaking. I create prints under the pseudonym Bodhi or bodh.io. The reason behind the pseudonym is:

Bodhi is the sanskrit word for awakening, and the process of creating art is essential to guiding me toward a path of enlightenment.
I purchased bodh.io as a domain name for because he thought is sounded cool. He decided to use the name as a way to display his art when he got into printmaking

When I am not busy honing my skills within the realm of printmaking, you can find me immersing myself at a live music event, in a museum, art gallery, or browsing wikipedia enjoying the infinite amount of information provided by the internet.


## Artist Statement

I focus on the craft of printmaking because it enables me to iteratively develop visual works of art. Although there are many different ways to create a print, I am uncommitted to a particular technique and open experimenting with all forms of the craft. I fell in love with the creative process and capacity to reproduce multiple variations of the same subject. For these reasons, the craft of printmaking is the perfect medium for me to experiment and explore ways of portraying transcendental experiences, unveiling cultural worldviews, and evoking intersubjectivity through my work.
