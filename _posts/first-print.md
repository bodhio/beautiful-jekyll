My first lino print ever made, was created during the first lesson of my introductory printmaking course at Morley College. The instructor gave all the students a square linoleum block to understand the process, with the goal of creating a print that night. It was amazing to go through the process of ideation, designing/drawing, engraving, and finally printing within the span of 3 hours on a monday evening. 

## Here is the first ever lino I created:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/img/first/first-lino.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" frameBorder="0" /></div>

Once we had it ready, we prepared the ink and had a go at making a print with it on the press. I decided to print mine on a diagonal, so the outcome was a diamond shape as oppose to square on the paper. I am pretty happy with the outcome.

## Here is the first print:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/img/first/first-lino.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" frameBorder="0" /></div>

I decided to experiment with black ink at a later date with the same block.

## Here is the print with black ink:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="/img/first/first-lino-black.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" frameBorder="0" /></div>

One day, I will try to get a cool gradient effect and create an edition of 25, which I will sell in my store online.
