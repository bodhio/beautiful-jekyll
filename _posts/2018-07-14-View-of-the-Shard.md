I printed an edition of 5 of this print for colleagues visiting from overseas. I intend on doing a series of architectural prints of iconic buildings and selling them in my [online store](https://bodhio.bigcartel.com). 

If you are interested in having an architectural print commissioned, please [get in touch](/contact).
