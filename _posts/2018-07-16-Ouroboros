I designed a print of the ouroboros motif, creating an infinite sign with flowers influenced from sacred geometry (namely <a href="https://www.krystleyez.com/the-seed-of-life/" target="_blank">the Seed of Life</a>) within the circles. 

The ouroboros is an ancient symbol dating back thousands of years. Often taken to symbolize introspection, the eternal return or cyclicality, especially in the sense of something constantly re-creating itself. It also represents the infinite cycle of nature's endless creation and destruction, life, and death. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros" target="_blank">Learn more about the ouroboros on Wikipedia</a>

The print displayed is just a trial proof, I have yet to make an edition with this lino block. When I decide on colourway to make an edition, I will update this post and sell the limited edition print in my [online store](https://bodhio.bigcartel.com). 

If you are interested in purchasing this print once editioned or have any feedback, please [get in touch](/contact).
