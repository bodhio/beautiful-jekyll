My first lino print ever made, was created during the first lesson of my introductory printmaking course at Morley College. The instructor gave all the students a square linoleum block to understand the process, with the goal of creating a print that night. It was amazing to go through the process of ideation, designing/drawing, engraving, and finally printing within the span of 3 hours on a monday evening. 

Once we had it ready, we prepared the ink and had a go at making a print with it on the press. I decided to print mine on a diagonal, so the outcome was a diamond shape as oppose to square on the paper. I am pretty happy with the outcome.

I decided to experiment with black ink at a later date with the same block.

One day, I will try to get a cool gradient effect and create an edition of 25, which will be for sale in my [online shop](https://bodhio.bigcartel.com).
