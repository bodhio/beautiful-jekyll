This edition is not for sale and the majority of impressions have been given away as gifts. I intend on doing a series of portraits in a similar style and perhaps selling some in my [online store](https://bodhio.bigcartel.com). 

If you are interested in having a portrait commissioned, please [get in touch](/contact).
