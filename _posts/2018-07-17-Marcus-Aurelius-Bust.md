Marcus Aurelius is one of my favourite philosophers, who's **Meditations** is a must read for anyone interested in stoicism and how to embrace the constant state of flux within the universe. It's public realm and can be <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2680" target="_blank">accessed for free online</a>.

I thought it would be nice to create a print which honours the eternal soul of the last great emperor of Rome.

During the summer months my local print studio (Morley College) is closed, so this was my first shot of trying to print at home and definitely won't be the last.

This print may be for sale in my __**[online shop](https://bodhio.bigcartel.com).**__

Also, in the future I want to make a two-layer print of Marcus Aurelius with a gradient background to create a <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a47793/what-happened-to-vaporwave/" target="_blabk">vaporwave</a> aesthetic.
